You can clone the repository and build ColoredTunes yourself or you can simply [grab the latest version on the releases page](https://github.com/simonbs/ColoredTunes/releases).

Usage
===

When you have start up ColoredTunes for the first time, it will show you the preferences. You will have to connect to your Philips Hue bridge. This is done by pressing "Search for bridge". ColoredTunes should take care of the rest. You might have to press the button on your bridge, though, but the app will tell you so if necessary.

When you have connected to your bridge, you can see your available light bulbs in the *Lights* preferences pane.
Select a light bulb and set one of the following types of colors for the bulb.

- Background Color
- Primary Color
- Secondary Color
- Details Color

These types of colors are calculated using your artwork. I recommend experimenting with them a bit, however, using the background color and the primary color usually produces good results.
You can also set a light bulb to *Inactive* and if you do se, ColoredTunes will not change the color of the light bulb.

Now you are ready to use ColoredTunes! Fire up Spotify and play some smashing tunes!
